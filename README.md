# UserAuth

A user authentication system built with Node JS provides secure user registration, login, and access control for web applications. It makes sure that only authorized users can access restricted resources or perform certain actions.

Working: 

The user authentication system project involves building a server-side application that handles user registration, login, password hashing, session management, and authorization checks. Node JS facilitates secure authentication and integrates with front-end technologies to provide a seamless user experience.

Salient Key Features:

    Registration: Allows users to create accounts with username and password.
    Login and Logout: Authenticates users with username/password and manages user sessions.
    Password Encryption: Stores passwords securely using hashing algorithms.
    Access Control: Implements role-based access control to restrict user actions.
    TODO : Multi-Factor Authentication: Supports additional authentication methods like OTP or biometrics.

Technology Used:

    Node JS
    Express Js
    MongoDB
    Crypto

For now can be used only via Terminal but will build a simple frontend soon
